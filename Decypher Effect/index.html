            Ciphertext is the output of an encryption process in which plaintext, or readable data, is transformed into a scrambled, unreadable form to protect its contents from unauthorized access. The purpose of converting plaintext into ciphertext is to ensure that sensitive information, such as passwords, financial data, or personal messages, remains secure during transmission or storage.
            Ciphertext is generated through the use of encryption algorithms, which apply mathematical operations to the plaintext. These algorithms require an encryption key, a secret piece of information that determines how the data is scrambled. The security of the ciphertext largely depends on the strength of the encryption algorithm and the secrecy of the key.
